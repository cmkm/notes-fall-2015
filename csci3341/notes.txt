An *operating system* is a collection of programs and data which manages computer resources and supports the virtual characteristics of the computer.

*Computer resource* - any hardware or software component of a computer.

### Managing computer resources
* Allocation / deallocation - resources allocated by OS as needed.
* Controlling - OS ensures resources cannot be misused or abused. Also makes sure resource works properly. (An example of abuse: using all memory. An example of misuse: using parts of memory not meant to use.)
* Facilitator - makes sure all needs of your program are provided.

*Virtual characteristics* - properties imagined to exist but which in reality do not. (Ex: natural languages.)

*Kernel* - nucleus portion of OS which must live in main memory while the machine is running.

OS always has empty space in its section of memory for loading subsystems when requested.

Kernel always occupies uppermost or lowermost part of main memory. Dedicated register knows where memory is available to user.

*System programs* - a collection of programs which provide convenience for the user. Tools for delivering OS services. Ex: command interpreter.
    * Application programs - word processors, DBMS, etc..
    * Program development aids - text editors, debug aids, compilers..
    * System utilities - copy, delete, sort, command interpreter

A *command interpreter* is either a collection of utilities, or a program with such a collection at its disposal.

### OS evolution
1. Sign-up scheme - only one person could use computer at a time. Work finished either before, exactly at end time, or slightly after end time is up. Memory dump to debug. Environment had to be set up each time.
2. Hiring operators - setup specialists to quicken environment setup. Reduced idle time. Time wasted shuffling software.
3. Batch processing - reduced time spend shuffling software. All programs needing a certain compiler were run at the same time. Owner of program has to note the needs of the program for the operator. Caused communication gap; attempted to be solved by job control language, or JCL. Invented by IBM Corp., first characters always "//" and last also "//".
4. JCL created
5. Automatic job sequencing - first OS created ("resident monitor")
    * Resident monitor consisted of four parts.
        1. Interrupt and trap vectors - arrays containing addresses to memory locations. INterrupt is a signal used by a resource to get the OS's attention. Every one has an interrupt ID containing the start address of the piece of code tat must be executed to handle the interrupt. Ex: interrupt has ID #5 →  go to vector index 5 →  vector contents at this index contain the memory address to code to handle. Interrupts come from the hardware; traps come from software. (Traps like exceptions, which can be handled within program by developer.)
        2. JCL interpreter
        3. Device driver
        4. Job sequencing

### Terminology
* *program* - written in a programming language. Static.
* *process* - a program as soon as it is in main memory. A candidate for execution by CPU. Dynamic
* *job* - general name for a program or a process.
* *one machine cycle*  - fetch, decode, execute. When a process is in execution, the CPU's registers contain data related to the process. This s the process status. A process can be frozen,a nd the status wl be moved to a location known by the OS. It can later be moved back to resume exactlwhere the process left off. 
* *another definition for OS* - event-driven software.
